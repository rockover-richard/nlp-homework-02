## pre-process.py and NB.py
The two scripts were written to follow the homework assignment as closely as possible.

If the scripts are run in the console, the scripts will ask if you want to run the steps or not.<br>
This is because the scripts take a good amount of time.

To use the default values for both scripts:
Type 'Y' or 'y' and just press enter. 

## pre-process.py
To run the script, please have the directory from the zip file in the root<br>
<b>starting with the aclImdb folder</b>

## NB.py
The script should be self-explanatory, but to use the default values,
please use the default filenames and files from pre-process.py and place them in the root. 

## movie-review-small.NB and movie-review-BOW.NB
The two output files asked for in the homework are in the root.

## BOW-predictions.NB and BOW-tf-idf-predictions.NB
These contain the predictions as outlined in the code and the writeup.<br>
They are also in the root.

## Vector files
The training and test data sets were too large (~4gb), and so were not included in the tarball.
