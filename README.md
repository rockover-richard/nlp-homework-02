## pre-process.py and NB.py
The two scripts were written to follow the homework assignment as closely as possible.

If the scripts are run in the console, the scripts will ask if you want to run the steps or not.<br>
This is because the scripts take a good amount of time.

To use the default values for both scripts:
Type 'Y' or 'y' and just press enter. 

## pre-process.py
To run the script, please have the directory from the zip file in the root<br>
<b>starting with the aclImdb folder</b>

## NB.py
The script should be self-explanatory, but to use the default values,
please use the default filenames and files from pre-process.py and place them in the root.
